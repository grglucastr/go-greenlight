# Greenlight API
An Open Source API for a Movies app. This is part of the course of Golang called ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go further‚Äú by Alex Edwards.

## üöÄ Features
- **User Registration:** Users can register in order to use the API.
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Users can login to access the reading resources. Other writing endpoints requires special permissions.
- **Movies Management:** Users can manage movies by adding, editing, listing, filtering and deleting.

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Go:** A recent version (e.g., go >= 1.24)
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **PostgresSQL:** The backend and the connectors are ready for PostgreSQL usage.
- **Make:** This API comes with a Makefile containing a set of automations to help run common tasks.

## üìã Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone [https://github.com/grglucastr/go-greenlight.git](https://github.com/grglucastr/go-greenlight.git)

```

## üèÉ Running the Application
